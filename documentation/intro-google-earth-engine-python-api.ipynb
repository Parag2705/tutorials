    "In addition to the web-based IDE Google Earth Engine also provides a Python API that can be run in a docker terminal on your local machine.\n",
    "This tutorial will go over how to setup the API on your machine as well as some basic Python scripts utilizing the API.\n",
    "It is important to note that the Python API does not support any kind of visual output; therefore, it is highly recommended that you use the Code Editor IDE.\n",

    "### Installing docker\n",
    "1. Find and install the correct version of [docker](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community). If you are using osx or windows this should be as simple as downloading and running an installer. On Ubuntu you can follow these [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)\n",
    "2. After you have installed docker verify your installation by running the following command `$ sudo docker run hello-world` This should print an informational message to your terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Earth Engine python Datalab Installation\n",
    "Once you have successfully installed docker use the commands found [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/python_install-datalab-local) to set up a workspace, and create a docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication\n",
    "After you have created a container you should be able open Datalab on in your browser once here navigate to the `docs-earthengine` directory and open the `authorize_notebook_server.ipynb` notebook. You can follow these instructions to complete the authentication process. Once authenticated you can begin to use Earthengine.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "To use the following code, you will have to upload this notebook to Datalab. To do this simply navigate to the notebooks folder, and click upload.\n",
    "\n",
    "First you will need to import Earth Engine and initialize the session. If you have correctly followed the authentication step your credentials should be saved in the docker terminal, and you should have no problem with initialization."
